    <h1>brings Vim moves to macOS input fields. and a bit more.</h1>
</div>

![awesome stuff happening in there](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/godbout/kindaVim.theapp/master/assets/gif.gif "hehe")

# WHY

brain space and energy are limited. why learning six hundred thousand new keyboard shortcuts when you can use Vim moves everywhere. also macOS is widely inconsistent like sometimes you can go up and down with ctrl+n/ctrl+p but also sometimes not. even in Apple's own apps. so jk FTW.

and also it's fucking cool.

# LOVED THE GIF?

maybe [watch the videos](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC3ZP3QFMhNn3ivJgqoEW4Ug) first if you're not sure you wanna read further.

# HOW DOES IT WORK

by default kindaVim runs in `Auto Mode` and tries to read the text of the focused app:

1. if it can read and modify the text, it uses the [kV Accessibility Strategy](#user-content-accessibility-strategy). theoritically you can have a full Vim experience. pragmatically some stuff will currently be missing so please [ask](https://github.com/godbout/kindaVim.theapp/issues/new) for what you need!
2. if it can't read the text, it uses the [kV Keyboard Strategy](#user-content-keyboard-strategy) and tries to impersonate Vim through key remapping. it's a little more wonky than the kV Accessibility Strategy.

in the `Preferences` you can also:
* ask kindaVim to ignore any app completely
* bypass macOS Accessibility restrictions with the `PG-R` Mode for apps where you can read the text but not modify it. you'll experience this mostly in browsers
* enforce the [kV Keyboard Strategy](#user-content-keyboard-strategy) for big fat liars apps that tell you they're implementing the macOS Accessibility but actually no no (all Electron apps)

# HOW 'BOUT THE MONEY

kindaVim will be a subscription of one ☕️ (USD$3) a month. the beta is free and contains the full set of features. i have no idea when i'll drop the beta. the beta may last 10 years. who knows. or maybe till 2047.

lol those tables.

# ROADMAP
* add a plethora of missing Vim moves ([ask!](https://github.com/godbout/kindaVim.theapp/issues/new))
* update all moves to support new global count system ([ask!](https://github.com/godbout/kindaVim.theapp/issues/new))
* better handling of Electron shit apps

# KNOWN ISSUES

* issues regarding End User Experience will be reported here: https://github.com/godbout/kindaVim.theapp/issues

kindaVim uses the macOS Accessibility API extensively. it's an old and buggy API. unfortunately there's a lot that we don't control. the API sometimes sends back wrong data. it also requires apps to implement the Accessibility in order to work. so even if i strive to make things consistent as much as possible, it is not always a success. all API bugs are reported to, and talked with Apple. please report if something does not seem to work properly, and i'll see what i can do.

# REQUESTS

* to request a missing move, open an issue: https://github.com/godbout/kindaVim.theapp/issues/new
